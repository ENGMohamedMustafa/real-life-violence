# Project Overview:

Our project aimed to leverage advanced computer vision models like VGG16 and ResNet50 to analyze patterns of real-world violence captured in video footage. The goal was to develop a robust system that could identify and classify different types of violent incidents, ultimately supporting preventive efforts.

# Key Approaches:

We started by importing the necessary deep learning libraries from TensorFlow, including pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet50.
The data was split into training and testing sets, with the training data used to fine-tune the pre-trained models for the specific task of violence detection.
Different model architectures were explored, comparing the performance of VGG16 and ResNet50 on the dataset. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize each model's accuracy.
Careful attention was paid to data preprocessing, including resizing and normalization, to ensure the models could effectively learn the relevant features.
# Results and Insights:

Our findings showed that the ResNet50 model, with its deeper architecture and advanced features, outperformed the VGG16 model in terms of accuracy and robustness on the violence detection task. The insights gained from this project can inform the development of more effective surveillance and intervention systems to address real-world violence.

# Next Steps:

Moving forward, we plan to expand the dataset, explore ensemble techniques, and investigate the interpretability of the models to better understand the key factors contributing to violent behaviors. Integrating this technology with other data sources could lead to even more comprehensive solutions.
